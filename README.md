# GeneticAlgorithm
This project was created to test a genetic algorithm. The Genetic algorithm is meant to produce a series of rotations and thrusts that allow the spaceships to navigate an astroid field. The project was made using the processing programming language.

# What I learned
* The basics of a genetic algorithm
* How to apply a genetic algorithm to problems
* How to detect collisions
